# What is this
Some stuff that I use to learn CMake.
# How do I use it
This is useless, if you want to build it, ig you can.
## How do I build it tho?
### 1. Git clone the stuff
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/zhiyan114/CMake_Test.git`
### 2. Create a build directory and cmake it
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```
### 3. Build it
`make`
### 4. All the build materials will be inside the bin folder.
## This is linux, wut about windows?
Same thing, except you can build it with cmake-gui and open up the generated sln to build it.
